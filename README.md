### Welcome to My Digital Marketing Analytics Repository!

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my repository for Marketing Analytics at California State University, East Bay. 

This collection showcases some of the work I've compiled while pursuing my master's degree in Marketing Analytics. 
It reflects my journey of learning, growing, and applying analytical techniques to solve marketing challenges.

I believe there is so much more to explore and achieve in this field. This repository is just the beginning of an exciting journey, and I am thrilled to see how these projects will evolve and contribute to real-world scenarios.

Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you find my work inspiring and insightful!
